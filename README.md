# Key Components:
## 1. Class Definition:

- **LibraryManagementSystem**: This class encapsulates all the functionalities of the library management system. It includes methods for adding, updating, and deleting member records, as well as displaying data.
## 2. GUI Layout:

- The main window is defined with the title "Library Management System" and a specific size.
- Several frames and labels are used to organize the layout, including the title, membership information, book details, and action buttons.
## 3. Variables:

- **StringVar()** variables are used to store and manage the data entered by the user, such as member type, PRN number, and book details.
## 4. Widgets:

- **Labels** and **Entries** are used to create input fields for user data (e.g., member type, PRN number).
- **Combobox** is used to allow selection of member types from a predefined list.
- **Listbox** and **Scrollbar** are used to display and navigate through a list of books. Selecting a book automatically populates related fields with predefined data.
- **Treeview** is used to display the library records in a tabular format.
## 5. Database Operations:

- The **add_data** method inserts new records into the MySQL database.
- The **update** method updates existing records.
- The **fetch_data** method retrieves all records from the database and displays them in the Treeview.
- The **get_cursor** method retrieves data from the selected row in the Treeview and displays it in the input fields.
## 6. Event Handling:

- The **SelectBook** function is triggered when a book is selected from the list. It auto-fills the corresponding fields with predefined data.
- The **showData** method displays the entered or selected data in the **TextBox**.
## 7. Buttons:

- Buttons for adding, showing, updating, deleting, resetting, and exiting are included, each linked to their respective methods.
# Suggested Improvements:
- **Error Handling** : Implement try-except blocks around database operations to handle potential errors, such as connection issues.
- **Form Validation** : Add validation for input fields to ensure that no mandatory fields are left empty.
- **User Feedback** : Provide more detailed feedback or confirmations to the user after actions like adding, updating, or deleting records.
- **Database Credentials** : Store database credentials in a secure way, possibly using environment variables or a configuration file, rather than hardcoding them in the script.
